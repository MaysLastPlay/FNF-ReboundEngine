## FNF': Rebound Engine
- Rebound Engine is a Friday Night Funkin' rewrite and maybe sucessor of SB Engine and this engine is made from ground up (in short week 7 source code is used or you call this: engine from scratch) which adds new cool features to the game.
# WARNING!!!
- Rebound Engine on very early development state!
- Currently you can't do anything for now
